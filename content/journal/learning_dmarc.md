I've recently been trying to get a better handle on how email works and how
it's secured. If you want to do the same. Go try out the exercises at
[https://www.learndmarc.com](https://www.learndmarc.com).

It's a great resource for visualizing how DMARC works in conjuction with
[Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208)
and [Domain Keys Identified mail
(DKIM)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4686) to secure email and
catch spam and phishing attempts.

There's even a quiz you can try to see how well you can analyze email traffic
and determine the DMARC results.
