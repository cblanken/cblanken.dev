Hello there! My name is Cameron and this is my little slice of the internet where I post about computer science, tech, CTFs and my current projects.

My formal degree is a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Computer Engineering from the University of Louisville. I've previously worked professionally as a software engineer developing [HMIs](https://realpars.com/what-is-hmi/) for parcel conveyance systems. I also have experience with Python, C#, Java, SQL, Javascript, and VBA. I'm currently looking to break into freelance web development or find a role as a security analyst.

If you find any of my ramblings helpful or are interested in any of my projects, please [let me know](mailto://cameron.blankenbuehler@gmail.com)! I hope you have a good day and enjoy your time here. Don't forget to be awesome.
