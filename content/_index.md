Hello there! My name is Cameron Blankenbuehler and this is my little slice of the internet where I post about computer science, tech, my current projects, CTFs, and whatever else catches my fancy.

My formal degree is a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Computer Engineering

If you find any of my ramblings helpful, please let me know! I hope you have a good day and enjoy your time here. Don't forget to be awesome. ðŸ™ƒ
