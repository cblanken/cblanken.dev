Hello there! My name is Cameron and this is my little slice of the internet where I post about computer science, tech, my current projects, CTFs, and whatever else catches my fancy.

My formal degree is a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Computer Engineering and I've previously worked as a software developer for control systems. I have experience with Python, C#, SQL, VBA and Javascript I'm currently looking to break into freelance web development or find a role as a security analyst.

If you find any of my ramblings helpful, please [let me know](mailto://cameron.blankenbuehler@gmail.com)! I hope you have a good day and enjoy your time here. Don't forget to be awesome. ðŸ™ƒ
